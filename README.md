# kick

Kick server for Streamy.gg, all kick related events will be handled on this server such as chat events, mod actions and everything else that happens on Twitch. This server will comunicate with the main backend to execute events from the backend as well as relay events to the backend.

# DISCLAIMER

This does not currently work due to Cloudflare blocking traffic from non browser environments, I will try to get into Kick's developer program when they open it up again.

Curse you BotRix
